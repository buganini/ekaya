Building and Installing Ekaya
=============================

Prerequisites:
  * Visual Studio Express 2008
  * Mercurial
  * Subversion
  * CMake from http://www.cmake.org/
  * NSIS (for installer)

The following commands are assumed to be run in a console setup as the Visual
Studio Command Prompt.

1. Clone the Ekaya repository into a directory ekaya. e.g.

hg clone http://www.thanlwinsoft.org/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/ekaya/ ekaya

2. Checkout win-iconv into the same directory:

svn checkout http://win-iconv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk win-iconv

3. Make a subdirectory under the top level ekaya directory and configure cmake 
in that directory. e.g.

cd ekaya
mkdir buildVS9
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" -i

4. Open the resulting ekaya\buildVS9\thanlwinsoft_ekaya.sln in Visual Studio
and build.

5. Use the installer target to build the NSIS installer. This will register the
ekaya.dll. 

The dll can also be registered on the command line in the build directory
containing ekaya.dll.

regsvr32 ekaya.dll

The iconv.dll and winkmfl.dll libraries must be available in the same directory
as ekaya.dll for the registration to succeed.

Ekaya can also be built using nmake rather than visual studio.
This is especially useful for building the 64 bit version using the Windows SDK.
Open the Windows SDK v7 command prompt and run:

SetEnv /x64 /Release
cd ekaya
mkdir build
cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles" -i
nmake
nmake installer
