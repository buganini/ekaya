<h1><img src="../ekaya.ico" alt=""/> Ekaya Input Method</h1>
<p>Ekaya Input Method currently supports Keyboard layouts written for Tavultesoft Keyman using the KMFL library. 
This means that the keyboard can do context specific reordering as you type to make sure that the data is stored in the correct order.
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Ekaya uses Windows Advanced Text Services. 
This can be configured in <em>Control Panel / Regional and Language Options</em> on the <em>Keyboards and Languages</em> tab. 
Click <em>Change Keyboards</em> to open the dialog.
Ekaya is configured to use the English-US locale, so you should find an <em>Ekaya Input Method</em> entry under English US on the <em>General</em> tab.
On the <em>Advanced Key Settings</em> tab you can configure Shortcut keys for Ekaya.
</p>
<h2>Using Ekaya</h2>

<p>When Ekaya is installed you can switch to using it from the keyboard icon either on the Task Bar or the Language Bar.
Click on the keyboard icon and select <em>Ekaya Input Method</em> from the menu.

There may be several KMFL keyboards installed, so you can switch between them on the Ekaya menu next to the ekaya icon <img src="../ekaya.ico" alt=""/>.
If the menu isn't visible, go to the Language Bar menu and make sure <em>Additional icons in taskbar</em> is ticked.
Ctrl+Space toggles between the Ekaya and normal keyboards.
</p>
<h2>Installing Keyboards</h2>
<p>Keyboards need to be written in Keyman/KMFL format with the <tt>.kmn</tt> file extension. Copy the <tt>kmn</tt> file into either
<tt>C:\Program Files\ThanLwinSoft.org\Ekaya\kmfl</tt> along with any bitmaps it references. 
If you have documentation in HTML format, copy it into the same directory with the same filename as the <tt>kmn</tt> file, but with the <tt>.html</tt> extension.
If you don't have administrator access, you can also install keyboards under <tt>AppData\Roaming\ThanLwinSoft.org\Ekaya\kmfl</tt> in your home directory (<tt>Application Data\ThanLwinSoft.org\Ekaya\kmfl</tt> on Windows XP).
